# Aim: To study and implement Recursion

# Software Required:
Visual Studio

# Theory:
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself repeatedly until a specific base condition is met. A function that performs such self-calling behavior is known as a recursive function, and each instance of the function calling itself is called a recursive call.

Recursive Function: A function that calls itself is called a recursive function. When a recursive function is called, it executes a set of instructions and then calls itself to execute the same set of instructions with a smaller input. A recursive function should contain, Recursive Case: Recursive case is the way in which the recursive call is present in the function. Base Condition: The base condition is the condition that is used to terminate the recursion.

Applications of Recursion:

Recursion has many applications in computer science and programming. Here are some of the most common applications of recursion:

Solving: Fibonacci sequences, Factorial Function, Reversing an array, Tower of Hanoi. Backtracking: It is a technique for solving problems by trying out different solutions and undoing them if they do not work. Recursive algorithms are often used in backtracking. Searching and Sorting Algorithms: Many searching and sorting algorithms, such as binary search and quicksort, use recursion to divide the problem into smaller sub-problems. Tree and Graph Traversal: Recursive algorithms are often used to traverse trees and graphs, such as depth-first search and breadth-first search. Mathematical Computations: Recursion is also used in many mathematical computations, such as the factorial function and the Fibonacci sequence. Dynamic Programming: It is a technique for solving optimization problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems. Recursive algorithms are often used in dynamic programming.


# Algorithms:

Reverse a String Using Recursion

1.Start

2.Declare a character array ch[50].

3.Prompt the user to "Enter a string" and read input into ch.

4.Define a recursive function rev(char* str):

If *str is not null (\0): Call rev(str + 1) recursively. Print the current character *str.

5.In main(), call rev(ch) to display the reversed string.

6.End

Reverse an Integer Using Recursion

1.Start

2.Declare an integer variable a.

3.Prompt the user to "Enter the number" and read input into a.

4.Define a recursive function revint(int a):

If a > 0:

Print a % 10 (the last digit of a).

Call revint(a / 10) recursively (removing the last digit).

5.In main(), call revint(a) to display the number in reverse.

6.End

 Sum of First n Natural Numbers Using Recursion

1.Start

2.Declare an integer variable n and another variable a for storing the result.

3.Prompt the user to "Enter a number" and read input into n.

4.Define a recursive function add(int n):
If n <= 1, return 1.
Else, return n + add(n-1) (sum of n and the sum of first n-1 numbers).

5.In main(), call add(n) and store the result in a.

6.Display the value of a.

7.End

 Factorial Using Recursion

1.Start

2.Declare an integer variable x and another variable A to store the factorial.

3.Prompt the user to "Enter the number" and read input into x.

4.Define a recursive function fact(int x):
If x <= 1, return 1.
Else, return x * fact(x-1) (multiply x by factorial of x-1).

5.In main(), call fact(x) and store the result in A.

6.Display "The factorial is : " followed by A.

7.End
